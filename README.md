## Synopsis

Sketch for a capacitive proximity / touch sensor with Arduino. This sensor based on a square wave generator rather 
than charge time measurement as the popular CapSense library. This design results in very stable sensor readings 
and it also works from a battery. It is compatible with virtually every Arduino board and even with most ATtiny chips.
The sketch depends on my Arduino [frequency counter library](https://github.com/domoszlai/arduino-frequency-counter).
